    "### OPTIONS FOR BOWTIE ###\n",
    "\"\n",
    "-n: Sets the number of mismatches allowed in an alignment. By default, Bowtie allows up to 2 mismatches.\n",
    "\n",
    "-e: Sets the maximum number of mismatches allowed in the seed alignment. This option is useful for controlling the sensitivity of the alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "-l: Specifies the length of the seed substrings used for alignment. Smaller seed lengths can result in faster alignment but may reduce sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "-I and -X: Sets the minimum and maximum insert sizes, respectively, for paired-end alignment. These options are useful for filtering out spurious alignments caused by insert size outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "-a: Performs all valid alignments for each read, rather than just the best alignment. This option can be useful for identifying potential multi-mapping reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "-y: Forces Bowtie to report only uniquely aligned reads. Reads with multiple valid alignments will be reported as unaligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "-m: Sets the maximum number of valid alignments to report for each read. This option is useful for controlling the number of reported alignments, especially for reads with multiple valid alignments.\n",
